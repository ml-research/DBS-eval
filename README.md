# DBS-eval 
The following repository contains the corpus of PYRAMID annotations, which were created on top of the DBS corpus (https://github.com/AIPHES/DBS).

### The Corpus
The source documents for DBS-eval as well as the manual summaries and several other automatic summaries can be found in https://github.com/AIPHES/DBS.
Included in the `Pyramids` folder are PYRAMIDS (.pyr files) for ten topics by three annotators.
Inlcuded in the `Automatic_summaries` folder are the automatic summaries, which were scored against these PYRAMIDS files.
Included in the `Pans` folder are the .pan files for each automatic summary, which was scored against the PYRAMIDS, for each of the three annotators.
The filenames contain the topic ID (1-10), the topic name and except for .pyr files the name of the summary system (lex, lsa, mz, text). The .pyr and .pan files also contain the ID of the annotator (a1, a2, a3).
